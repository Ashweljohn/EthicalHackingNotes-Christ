DAY 3

Linux provides a powerful set of commands to manage files and directories efficiently. To begin with, you can navigate the file system using commands like pwd, which prints the current working directory, and cd, which is used to change directories. For instance, cd Documents moves into the Documents folder, cd .. moves up to the parent directory, and simply typing cd brings you back to your home directory.

To view files and directories in the current location, you can use ls. Adding options enhances its functionality: ls -l shows detailed information including permissions and file sizes, ls -a reveals hidden files, ls -lh presents human-readable sizes, and ls -R lists contents recursively. Creating files and directories is also straightforward. The touch command is used to create empty files (e.g., touch file.txt), while mkdir creates new directories. For creating nested directories in one go, mkdir -p dir1/dir2 is used.

Copying and moving files is handled with cp and mv. For example, cp file.txt backup.txt makes a copy of a file, and cp -r dir1 dir2 copies an entire directory recursively. The mv command is used to move or rename files and directories. So, mv old.txt new.txt renames a file, and mv file.txt /home/user/docs moves it to another location.

To delete files, rm is used. A simple rm file.txt deletes a file, while rm -r folder/ removes a directory and all its contents. To remove an empty directory, rmdir is used. If you want to delete files without confirmation prompts, rm -f will force the deletion. Additionally, the stat command displays detailed file information such as size and timestamps, while file identifies the type of file based on its content.

Using these commands, users can fully manage their file system from the terminal with speed and precision. Remember, using the Tab key for auto-completion and adding options to commands (like -l, -r, or -a) can save a lot of time and reduce typing errors.

### üîç **Reconnaissance in Cybersecurity**

**Definition**:
**Reconnaissance** is the **first phase** of the ethical hacking or cyberattack lifecycle. It involves **gathering information** about a target system, network, or organization **before launching an attack**. Think of it like a thief studying a building before breaking in.

---

### üß† **Purpose of Reconnaissance**

* To **understand the target's environment**
* Identify **vulnerabilities**, **open ports**, **IP addresses**, **technologies used**
* Reduce chances of **detection** during the actual attack
* Plan effective attacks or penetration tests

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Types of Reconnaissance**

| Type              | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Passive Recon** | Collecting info **without interacting** directly with the target. Example: looking at social media, WHOIS data, Google searches. |
| **Active Recon**  | Directly engaging with the target to gather information. Example: scanning networks, pinging devices, port scanning.             |

---

### üîß **Common Recon Tools**

| Tool             | Use                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nmap**         | Network scanning, open ports, services                         |
| **Wireshark**    | Packet analysis (network traffic)                              |
| **theHarvester** | Email, subdomain, and employee information gathering           |
| **Maltego**      | Visual link analysis for people, companies, domains, and IPs   |
| **Google Dorks** | Using advanced search techniques to find sensitive information |

---

### üßæ **Examples of Information Collected**

* IP address ranges
* Subdomains
* Open ports
* Software versions
* Employee names or emails
* DNS records

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why It Matters**

In ethical hacking, reconnaissance helps in:

* Finding weak points before an attacker does
* Strengthening defenses proactively
* Simulating real-world attack planning for better security

**Low Privilege User**
A low privilege user is an account with minimal access rights and permissions, typically restricted to basic system usage such as opening approved applications, reading allowed files, and performing non-administrative tasks. This follows the *Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)*, which aims to reduce security risks by limiting what each user can do. Even if compromised, such an account cannot directly make critical system changes or access sensitive data, helping contain potential damage. An example is a standard employee account without administrator rights.

---

**Security Operations Center (SOC)**
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a dedicated team or facility responsible for continuously monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity threats in an organization. SOC analysts use tools such as SIEM systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and firewall logs to identify suspicious activities. The SOC‚Äôs main functions include real-time threat monitoring, incident response, threat intelligence gathering, and reporting on security incidents for compliance and management. Operating 24/7, SOCs act as the nerve center of an organization‚Äôs cybersecurity defense.

---

**Data Exfiltration**
Data exfiltration refers to the unauthorized transfer of sensitive data from within a network to an external destination, often carried out by malicious insiders or external attackers. This can happen through methods such as malware sending data over the internet, unauthorized copying to USB drives, or sending confidential information via email. Data exfiltration is a serious security breach as it can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences. Preventive measures include data loss prevention (DLP) tools, encryption, strict access controls, and continuous monitoring of data movements.

---

**Privilege Escalation**
Privilege escalation is the process of gaining higher access rights than initially granted, often exploited by attackers after obtaining entry into a low privilege account. There are two main types: *vertical escalation*, where a standard user gains administrative or root privileges, and *horizontal escalation*, where a user gains access to another user‚Äôs resources without higher privileges. Common techniques include exploiting software vulnerabilities, misconfigured permissions, and stealing credentials. Successful privilege escalation can lead to full system control, disabling of security measures, and easier execution of further attacks.
